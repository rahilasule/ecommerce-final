                illegal, or otherwise objectionable which may constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the
                rights of any party or which may otherwise give rise to liability or violate any law. You may not upload
                commercial content on the Services or use the Services to solicit others for any other commercial online
                service or other organization.</p>

            <p style="display:block">
                    You may not without the prior written permission of Biruang, use any computer code, data mining
                    software, "robot", "bot", "spider", "scraper" or other automatic device, or program, algorithm or
                    methodology having similar processes or functionality, or any manual process, to monitor or copy
                    any of the web pages, data or content found on this Site, or accessed through this Site.
                    You may not engage in the mass downloading of files from the Services; use the computer
                    processing power of the Services for purposes other than those permitted above; or flood the
                    Services with electronic traffic designed to slow or stop its operation. You may not establish
                    links to or from other websites to the Services without the prior written consent of Biruang.</p>
            <h2>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</h2>
            <p style="display:block">
                The Services and the materials, Widgets and products on the Services are provided "as is" and without
                warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable
                law, Biruang disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties
                of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Biruang does not represent or
                warrant that the functions contained in the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected,
                or that the Services or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or other harmful components. Biruang does
                not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials in the Services in terms
                of their correctness, accuracy, reliability or otherwise. You (and not Foot Locker) assume the entire cost of all necessary
                servicing, repair or correction. Some states do not permit limitations or exclusions of implied warranties, so the above
                limitations may not apply to you.</p>

            <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
            <p>
                Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall Biruang be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive,
                incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the use of or the inability to use the Services or the performance
                of the products, even if Biruang or authorized representatives of Biruang have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                Some states do not permit limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
                exclusion may not apply to you. In no event shall Biruang's total liability to you for damages, losses and causes of action
                (whether in contract, negligence or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing the Services.</p>

            <h2>OTHER</h2>
            <p>
                These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, U.S.A., without giving effect
                to any principles of conflicts of law, and expressly not by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of
                Goods. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms shall be filed only in the state or federal
                courts located in New York County and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. If any provision of these
                terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect
                the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Biruang's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any
                provision of these terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This is the entire agreement between us relating
                to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except as described herein.</p>
